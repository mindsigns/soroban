  <h4>But first, a cautionary tale against forgetting your password</h4>
  <p>...Ali Baba told his brother, Cassim, about the treasure in a cave and that
  he just needed to say "Open Sesame" at the entrance to get in. This he did, but
  once he was inside, the door to the cave suddenly shut, and Cassim realized that
  he had forgotten the password -- and no system administrator to help him!
  "Open Barley!" he cried, and then he shouted out names of many other grains,
  perhaps even "Open Maize!", but all to no avail. Eventually, the robbers whose
  treasure it was came to the cave and killed and quartered Cassim. Then they
  hung him up at the entrance to the cave as a warning to any others careless
  enough to forget their passwords...</p>
  <h3>Openmaize</h3>
  <p>Openmaize is an authentication library for Elixir. It aims to be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>secure</li>
    <li>lightweight</li>
    <li>framework-agnostic</li>
    <li>well-documented</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Openmaize depends on Plug for much of its functionality, and it uses Comeonin
  and Plug sessions for authentication.</p>
